# ASAP
As-soon-as-possible static site generator.

### Introduction

This is a project I'm undertaking in order to further practice:
 * High-level programming with C++.
 * Web development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
 * Efficient programming techniques, hence 'as-soon-as-possible'.
 * Process documentation and project planning, albeit on a small scale.

I was inspired to take up the project by the blogs and personal websites of the tech community, frequently linked to on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news). Of those generated by static site generators, most are products of established projects such as [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [...]. Some of the more aesthetically unique, though, are generated by custom built site generators (for example [computer.rip](https://computer.rip), see the footnote).

The motivation behind this project is twofold:
 1. To create a tool I can use to generate my own website ([theoaddis.com](https://theoaddis.com)).
 2. To bolster my GitHub.
